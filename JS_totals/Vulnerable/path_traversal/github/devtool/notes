Notes: the `interceptBufferProtocol('file', …)` handler is **vulnerable**: it rewrites any `file://` URL to a filesystem path based on
`file = file.substring(7); file = path.resolve(cwd, path.relative(__dirname, file));`
This allows **absolute-path override** and **traversal via symlinks**. For example, a `file:///etc/passwd` request becomes a path that can resolve outside your project. You meant to restrict loads to the current working directory (`cwd`), but there’s no containment check.
Both versions included in the dataset.

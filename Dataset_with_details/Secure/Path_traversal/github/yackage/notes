Notes: this is a packaging/CLI script that operates on directories you explicitly pass in (appDir, outputDir). It doesn’t accept attacker-controlled HTTP paths, nor does it try to confine a user path under a fixed sandbox and then fail to enforce it (which is what classic path traversal exploits). Joins like path.join(outputDir, 'LICENSE'), path.join(appDir, 'package.json'), and ASAR globbing all act within those caller-chosen roots. The tar extraction uses the tar package’s defaults (which reject absolute paths / .. by default), so Zip-Slip style traversal via the npm pack tarball is mitigated.

Notes: the routeless MVC handler is almost safe, but it can be abused via symlink traversal in the views directory.
findExistingFile() uses path.resolve() on viewsDir/baseName+ext and checks with path.relative(), but resolve() does not resolve symlinks. If views/<page>.html is a symlink to /etc/passwd, the check still passes and res.sendFile() will follow the link and serve a file outside your views root.
This is fixed version.

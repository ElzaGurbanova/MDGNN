Note: Fixed version. It builds a shell command string and calls exec. Even though you JSON.stringify the inputs, the resulting strings are inserted inside single quotes—if the JSON contains a ', it breaks out and can inject shell syntax. Use execFile with an argv array so there’s no shell to escape.

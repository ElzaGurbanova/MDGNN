Notes: vulnerable in two places.
In the API dynamic loader, you build routePath = path.join(__dirname, req.path) (which ignores __dirname if req.path starts with /) and then use that routePath for imports. Although you compute a safe resolvedPath, you never actually use it â€” so a crafted path could steer imports outside the intended api/ tree.
In the WebSocket router, loadWSHandler(routeName) does path.join(WSS_DIR, \${routeName}.js`)with no containment checks. A route like/api/wss/../../serverwould resolve outsidewss/` and let an attacker import arbitrary JS modules on the server.
Both versions in the dataset.
